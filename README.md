Hello! I live in my house, which, believe it or not, is next to my neighbor's house!

I like programming and making stupid jokes about everything.

I'm the creator of ~~useless wastes of time~~ some projects, such as:
- <a href=https://github.com/DisableGraphics/zGreending/> zGreending </a>
- <a href=https://github.com/DisableGraphics/Scoop/> Scoop </a>

<!---
DisableGraphics/DisableGraphics is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
